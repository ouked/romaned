    <div id="bio">
        An artist, management student and freelance designer, living between France and the United Kingdom.
        I spent time working and travelling in South America and Spain last year to gain real-world professional
        experience and become fluent in Spanish.

        Drawing and Painting has always been a large part of my life. Recently, I've been experimenting with new styles
        and techniques to apply my creativity to the digital world.

        Below are a few examples of my work. Please enjoy, and please email me for commissions.
